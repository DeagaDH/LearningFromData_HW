    "Consider that we initially have 3 points assigned the same value +1. These points define a plane, which separates the $R^3$ space in two parts. For the perceptron, one side of this plane should have all other points with the +1 value, while the other side should have all points with -1 value. Consider we now add a point (totalling 4 points) of value -1. It can go on either side of the plane; that will just define said side to be the -1 side, while the other side is the +1 side. If we add another point (totalling 5 points) of value -1, but place it on a different side of that same plane, we have now shattered the 3D perceptron, as a single perceptron won't be able to split these 5 points with just one plane. Therefore, **the breakpoint for the 3D Perceptron is 5 points (Alternative b)**."
